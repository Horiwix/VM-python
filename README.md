# Stack based Virtual Machine written in Python

POC of Virtual Machine written in Python.

Only a handful of operations supported. Includes test codes to print `Hello, World!` and loop with value incrementation and condition check.

Popular stack based VM's:
* Java Virtual Machine (instructions - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings)
* CPython (instructions - https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#python-bytecode-instructions)
